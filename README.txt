Small game that helps children learn addition of numbers 0-10. 
I reserve the right to expand the game to include higher numbers, subtraction, and other operations. 


At this point it's just a few python classes, some images, and sounds. Pygame is used for most objects. 
An addition problem is displayed. Polygons move down from the top of the screen with number labels on them. 
If a polygon is clicked, the corresponding number is checked to see if it is a correct answer to the addition problem. 
A score label is updated + or - 1. Up or down arrows adjust the volume. S mutes the app.
